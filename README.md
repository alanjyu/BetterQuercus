# Better Quercus Javascript

Please note that I am not a professional web developper by any means. Use at your own risk!

## Installation

- Install a javascript hosting extension for your browser (e.g., [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Violetmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/))
- Click [here](https://github.com/alanjyu/better-quercus.js/raw/master/better-quercus.user.js) and click "install".

Note: If your school is also using the Canvas framework, this will likely work! Message me if you want your school's URL to be included. If this causes incompability, you can send a pull request or fork and maintain the project yourself.
