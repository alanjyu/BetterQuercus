# Better Quercus Chrome Extension

Please note that I am not a professional web developper by any means. Use at your own risk! To access the legacy userscript (which still works!), click [here](https://github.com/alanjyu/BetterQuercus/tree/userscript).

Note: If your school is also using the Canvas framework, this will likely work! Message me if you want your school's URL to be included. If this causes incompability, you can send a pull request or fork and maintain the project yourself.
